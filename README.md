Interactive map with selectable layers

Using Mapbox and the omnivore and leaflet APIs, this map displays the globe and creates a checklist of selectable layers with custom markers for each layer. 

Data in this example are of the wild tomato species (Solanum sect. Lycopersicum), with each species representing a selectable layer. Data used in this map are publicly available and can be downloaded from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC; http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/).

The corresponding csv file includes latitude, longitude, population and species information for each tomato population in the TGRC collection.
